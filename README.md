Practice: Stacking Words
The learning objects of this exercise is to use iteration and string concatenation
Create an addExcitement function that should console.log() rows of words. It should take an array containing the words of a sentence and output them in the developer console.

Practice: Some words are more exciting than others
The learning objective of this exercise is to use the JavaScript if statement inside a loop to do one operation when a certain conditions is true, and a different operation if that condition is false.

Add logic to addExcitement that places an exclamation point (!) after every third word. Read the following English statement and write the equivalent in JavaSript code to make it work.

If the current value of the counter variable can be evenly divided by 3 (using the JavaScript remainder operator) add a single exclamation point (!) to the current word in the array.

Example output:

The

The walrus

The walrus danced!

The walrus danced! through

The walrus danced! through the

The walrus danced! through the trees!

The walrus danced! through the trees! in

The walrus danced! through the trees! in the
